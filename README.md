## Instructions

1. For this app, we will need NPM packages. Clone down the repo to a local directory, and from your bash please navigate over to the "scrapehw" folder in your terminal, and type in your command line: "npm install"


2. Once you have installed all of the NPM packages needed, you can then run the line of code: "node server.js" to start up our server, which will say "Connected on 3000" if you are succesfully connected. Then, you would open up your browser and go to https://localhost:3000/

3. Upon landing, you will see all the scraped articles from CoinDesk, and when you click the article you will be able to save a note to that specific article.
